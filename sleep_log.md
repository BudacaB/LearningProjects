Chronosleep

Def/scope: A web app where an user can log on and keep a sleep & sleep related habits diary

UX:
1. Basic web interface for user log on - email and password fields/boxes screen
   1.1 Option to connect with X Y Z?

2. Next screen (HP) has a leftside options panel or 'header' for toggling between screens with buttons and a 'display area' (always?), clock above always, other needed buttons/text (some always present like account etc / others as needed - save or cancel etc)

3. The 'Log' button in the options panel takes the user to the screen where the new entry is to be filled
   3.1 several sections(table?, input boxes, dropdowns etc):
        The time you went to bed and woke up.
        How long and well you slept.
        When you were awake during the night.
	How much caffeine or alcohol you consumed and when.
	What/when you ate and drank.
	What emotion or stress you had.
	What drugs or medications you took.
	Exercise you had during the day and what time.
  	etc.
	     3.2 Different ratings that can be given on the above

4. Another button for access to an entry history screen
   4.1 Basic table with entry timestamp and some kind of generic title - e.g. Entry 1, 2...
   4.1 How are things displayed? Layout?

5. Another button to maybe a stats screen displaying info related to the user ratings (3.2)
